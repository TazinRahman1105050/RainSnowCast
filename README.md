# Forecast total cool-season precipitation for the Sacramento drainage basin in California
This repository contains the project submission from Team 7 for the Washington State University (WSU) Digital AgAthon 2023.

We developed and deployed machine learning models to forecast cool-season (November‚ÄìMarch) precipitation, including both rainfall and snowfall, in California‚Äôs Sacramento Basin, using historical geospatial and climate data.

The goal of this project is to explore novel data-driven approaches to seasonal precipitation forecasting, aiming to reduce risks to water systems and assist water managers in making informed decisions for hydrological planning.

üóÇÔ∏è Data Sources
Our models were trained on observational datasets from 1980 to 2022, which include:
-Sea surface temperature (SST) patterns
-Climate indices representing atmospheric circulation regimes
-Soil moisture levels
-Sea ice coverage prior to the forecast period

‚öôÔ∏è Technologies
Models: LSTM, GRU
Platform: Microsoft Azure

We hope this work contributes toward better seasonal precipitation forecasting for climate resilience and sustainable water management.
